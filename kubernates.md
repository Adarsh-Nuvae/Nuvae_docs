Ah üëç if you want to remove the **entire `preview` namespace itself** (not just the pods inside), you can do it like this:

---

### üî• Delete the namespace (removes everything inside it)

```bash
kubectl delete namespace preview
```

That will delete:

* All pods
* Deployments
* Services
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets
* PVCs
* etc.

Basically everything scoped to that namespace.
