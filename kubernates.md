### kubectl config get-contexts
 - Check which cluster its pointing to
 - if minicube local
 - If it’s my-remote, then it’s pointing to the remote cluster.
 - CURRENT   NAME           CLUSTER        AUTHINFO       NAMESPACE
          minikube       minikube       minikube       default
          my-remote      my-remote      user-remote    default
Ah 👍 if you want to remove the **entire `preview` namespace itself** (not just the pods inside), you can do it like this:

---

### 🔥 Delete the namespace (removes everything inside it)

```bash
kubectl delete namespace preview
```

That will delete:

* All pods
* Deployments
* Services
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets
* PVCs
* etc.

Basically everything scoped to that namespace.

Got it ✅
Here’s a **clear, beginner-friendly note** you can share with your team about how you solved the Minikube PVC storage issue.

# 📝 How We Fixed PVC Storage Issues in Minikube

When we first deployed our app on **Minikube**, our **PVCs (PersistentVolumeClaims)** were stuck in **Pending** state.
This happened because:

* PVCs were trying to bind to a specific **volumeName** (like `preview-edi-pv`).
* That PV was already used by another claim, so Kubernetes refused to bind.

---

## 🔧 The Fix

Instead of pointing to a fixed `volumeName`, we let Minikube’s **default storage class (`standard`)** dynamically create PVs for us.

### Steps we took:

1. **Check PVCs and their status**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc -n preview
   ```

   * Before fix → `Pending`
   * After fix → `Bound` ✅

2. **Check the PVC details**

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pvc preview-edi-pvc -n preview
   ```

   * Before → Error: “volume already bound to a different claim”
   * After → Shows correct dynamic PV binding.

3. **Remove/avoid `volumeName` in YAMLs**

   * In our Helm chart `.tpl` files, we had `volumeName: something`.
   * We removed that line so Kubernetes could auto-bind PVCs to dynamically created PVs.

4. **Let Minikube auto-provision PVs**

   * Minikube has a built-in `standard` storage class.
   * As soon as PVCs were created, Minikube made matching PVs automatically.

## ✅ Final Result

After redeploy:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n preview
```

All PVCs are **Bound** 🎉
